He identified the water source responsible for an outbreak of cholera in London by mapping the locations of those afflicted.\n\n![John Snow's map, published in his On The Mode Of Communication Of Cholera, of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London is one of the best known examples of data visualization and information design.](images_spatial/johnsnow_map.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nBy plotting the number and location of fatalities using stacks of bars on a map, Snow was able to perform a task that is now easily taken for granted: he visualized a spatial distribution. Looking at the results, the pattern on the map seems unmistakable. The map appears to support Snow's claims that cholera is a waterborne disease and that the pump on Broad Street is the source of the outbreak.\n\n![The Pump Neighborhood](images_spatial/johnsnow_map2.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nDespite its hand-drawn, back-of-the-envelope appearance, Snow writes:\n\n*\"The inner dotted line on the map shows the various points which have been found by careful measurement to be at an equal distance by the nearest road from the pump in Broad Street and the surrounding pumps ...\"*\n\nWith these words let us recreate John Snows famous map of Cholera in R.\n\nBut first, some best practices:\n\n:::\n\n## Cartographic Guidelines for Public Health\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nGeography and Geospatial Science Working Group (GeoSWG) has recognised the need for best practices in cartography. With this purpose Centre for Disease Control (CDC, Atlanta) has come up with the Cartographic Guidelines for Public Health. Adhering to these guidelines, help the researchers develop high-quality, consistent map products to promote the mission of public health.\n\nSome of the important aspects of these guidelines are:\n\n-   Map Elements\n    -   Title and Borders\n    -   North Arrow / Graticule / Scale\n    -   Inset Maps\n    -   Labels and Legend\n-   Other Elements\n    -   Data Sources\n    -   Dates\n    -   Information about Data Processing\n    -   Projection\n\n![A illustration of the various map elements arranged according to the Cartographic Guidelines by the CDC](images_spatial/map_elements_1.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n### Map Projection\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nProjections transform the curved, three-dimensional surface of the earth into a flat, two-dimensional plane. All map projections have distortions (distance, area, direction, and/or shape). The choice of projection depends on the intended use of the map. An equal-area map projection is a good selection for portraying geographic data distributions and is suitable for most other maps. However, if the map is attempting to show distance from patients to providers, for example, then an equidistant projection is appropriate because it preserves distance.\n\n![The three families of map projections. They can be represented by: a) cylindrical projections, b) conical projections or c) planar projections.](images_spatial/projection_families.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe sometimes refer to coordinate systems (or grid systems) and datums in context with map projections. With the help of coordinate reference systems (CRS) every place on the earth can be specified by a set of three numbers, called coordinates. Various coordinate systems and datums are used throughout the world. Most mapping starts with a projected map and a coordinate system overlay, which enables locational referencing. Datums, based upon different ellipsoids (idealized versions of the shape of the earth), define the origin and orientation of latitude and longitude lines. The most recently developed and widely used datum is WGS 1984. Global positioning system (GPS) data are often collected in the WGS 1984 datum.\n\n![Different Examples of projection systems](images_spatial/different_projections.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIt is important to note that this CRS represented in can be represented in many ways. For example:\n\n`PROJ.4` format as `+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +type=crs`, and in Well Known Text (WKT) format as\n\n> GEOGCS\\[\"WGS 84\", DATUM\\[\"WGS_1984\", SPHEROID\\[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563\\]\\], PRIMEM\\[\"Greenwich\",0\\], UNIT\\[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433, AUTHORITY\\[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"\\]\\], AUTHORITY\\[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"\\]\\]\n\n:::\n\n## Spatial Files and Extensions\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nThere are over 60 different file formats in GIS. They can be broadly classified into vector file formats and raster file formats.\n\nVector graphics are comprised of vertices and paths. The three basic symbol types in vector data are points, lines and polygons. Among vector data, the commonly used file formats are the ESRI Shape file extensions (`.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`), Geographic JavaScript Object Notation (`.geojson`, `.json`) and Google Keyhole Markup Language (`.kml`, `.kmz`). Please note that all files of the ESRI Shapefiles are necessary for the file to work properly.\n\nOn the contrary, raster data is made up of pixels, also referred to as grid cells). They are usually square but can also be hexagons or other shapes. Rasters have pixels that are associated with a value (continuous) or class (discrete). One of the most widely used raster formats are the GeoTiff extensions (`.tif`, `.tiff`).\n\nWith this background, we can now begin to recreate John Snow's map.\n\n:::\n\n## Introducing the `sf` package\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\n![](images_spatial/sf_hex_sticker.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"129\"}\n\nThere are several packages that are available on CRAN that can perform spatial analytical tasks and operations. However, not all of them are having continued support from the original authors and are turning obsolete.\n\nThe figure below shows the different spatial packages on CRAN and their popularity, its is clear that the `sf` package has surpassed all other packages in terms of popularity and user downloads.\n\n![Downloads of selected R packages for working with geographic data from early 2013 to present. The y axis shows the average number of dailly downloads from the popular cloud.r-project.org CRAN mirror with a 3-month rolling window (log scale)](images_spatial/spatial_packages_cran.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"300\"}\n\nThe `sf` package provides simple features access for R. Simple Features is a set of standards that specify a common storage and access model of geographic feature made of mostly two-dimensional geometries (point, line, polygon, multi-point, multi-line, etc.) used by geographic information systems. It is formalized by both the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\n![](images_spatial/sf_package_1.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"400\"}\n\n:::\n\n### What is a feature?\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\n![](images_spatial/sf-classes.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"300\"}\n\nA feature is thought of as a thing, or an object in the real world, such as a building or a tree. As is the case with objects, they often consist of other objects. A set of features can form a single feature. A tree in a forest can be a feature, a forest can be a feature, a city can be a feature. An image pixel from a satellite can be a feature, or a complete MRI scan image can be a feature too.\n\n:::\n\n### The common seven simple feature types\n\n![Common types of geometry in \\`sf\\` package](images_spatial/sf_geometry_types.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"582\"}\n\n## The Data\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nToday we shall be working with one of the in built datasets in R. There are other ways to import the different spatial files in R with the `sf` package. You can look into the documentation of the `sf` package for additional help (<https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/>). The datasets from the cholera outbreak in 1854 are available from the `HistData` package. The data sets used in this chapter are:\n\n-   `Snow.deaths`\n-   `Snow.streets`\n-   `Snow.pumps`\n\nThe datasets are available as `dataframe` objects. We need to manipulate them into `sf` objects as it is the best practice (and also very intuitive and easy to work with). Let us look at the `head` of dataset `Snow.deaths` to understand its structure.\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n\nHistData::Snow.deaths %>% head()\n```\n\nWe can now manipulate the spatial file into an `sf` object.\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n\nsnow_deaths <- HistData::Snow.deaths %>%\n  as_tibble() %>% \n  st_as_sf(., coords = c('x', 'y'), crs = 4326)\n```\n\nThe above code takes the dataset Snow.deaths from the HistData package and converts it into an `sf` object with additional arguments `coords` (which specifies the column representing the latitude and longitude respectively) and `crs` which takes the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) code for the coordinate reference system (<https://epsg.io>). We are also creating it as a new object names `snow_pumps` for future reference.\n\nWe can check the class of the newly created object.\n\n```{r}\nsnow_deaths %>% class()\n```\n\nLets print the object in the console and have a look.\n\n```{r}\nsnow_deaths\n```\n\nCongratulations! You've just created your first `sf` object.\n\nNow, lets plot the `sf` object using the `ggplot2`'s `geom_sf` wrapper.\n\n```{r}\n\n\nsnow_deaths %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf() \n\n```\n\nNow, Lets load and look at the streets of Soho, London. However, the streets are represented as points which might be tricky to manipulate. However, thanks to the mighty `sf` package, we can perform this task in an elegant way.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n\nsnow_streets <- HistData::Snow.streets %>% \n  st_as_sf(., coords = c('x', 'y'), crs = 4326) %>% \n  group_by(street) %>% \n  summarize(n = mean(n)) %>% \n  st_cast('LINESTRING')\n\nsnow_streets %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_sf()\n```\n\nNow lets overlay the cholera deaths over the streets. We can optionally color the deaths in red and set transparency at 20% for better visualisation.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = snow_streets) +\n  geom_sf(data = snow_deaths, color = 'red', alpha = 0.2, size = 3)\n```\n\nLets add the pumps now...

Add nifty little labels using the function `geom_sf_label`.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n#| eval: false\n\n\nsnow_pumps <- HistData::Snow.pumps %>% \n  st_as_sf(., coords = c('x', 'y'), crs = 4326)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = snow_streets) +\n  geom_sf(data = snow_deaths, color = 'red', \n          alpha = 0.2, size = 3) +\n  geom_sf(data = snow_pumps , shape = 22, \n          size = 4, fill = 'blue', color = 'blue') +\n  geom_sf_label(data = snow_pumps, aes(label = label),\n                nudge_x = 0.025, nudge_y = -0.5)\n\n```\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}} \n\n\n![](images_spatial/snow_deaths_streets_pumps_plot.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n\n\n\nCongratulations on making your first map in R.\n\n**Exercise**\n\n1.
