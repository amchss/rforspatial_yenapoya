Let us dive deep into understanding the environment further in the workshop.\n\n:::\n\n## Creating a project.\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nIt is important to understand that good workflows facilitate efficient database management. Lets discuss!\n\n:::\n\n## File types in R\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nThe most common used file types are\n\n1.  `.R` : Script file\n2.  `.Rmd` : RMarkdown file\n3.  `.qmd` : Quarto file\n4.  `.rds` : Single R database file\n5.  `.RData` : Multiple files in a single R database file\n\n:::\n\n## Programming basics.\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nR is easiest to use when you know how the R language works. This section will teach you the implicit background knowledge that informs every piece of R code. You'll learn about:\n\n1.  Functions and their arguments\n2.  Objects\n3.  R's basic data types\n4.  R's basic data structures including vectors and lists\n5.  R's package system\n\n:::\n\n### Functions and their arguments.\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nTo do anything in R, we call functions to work for us. Take for example, we want to compute square root of 5197. Now, we need to call a function `sqrt()` for the same.\n\n```{r}\nsqrt(5197)\n```\n\n**Important things to know about functions include:**\n\n1.  **Code body**.\n\nTyping code body and running it enables us understand what a function does in background.\n\n```{r}\nsqrt\n```\n\n2.  **Run a function**.\n\nTo run a function, we need to add a parenthesis `()` after the code body. Within the parenthesis we add the details such as number in the above example.\n\n3.  **Help page**.\n\nPlacing a question mark before the function takes you to the help page. This is an **important** aspect we need to understand. When calling help page parenthesis is not placed. This help page will enable you learn about new functions in your journey!\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\n?sqrt \n```\n\n:::\n\n**Tip:**\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nAnnotations are meant for humans to read and not by machines. It enables us take notes as we write. As a result, next time when you open your code even after a long time, you will know what you did last summer :)\n\n<br>\n\n**Arguments** are inputs provided to the function. There are functions which take no arguments, some take a single argument and some take multiple arguments. When there are two or more arguments, the arguments are separated by a comma.\n\n```{r}\n# No argument\nSys.Date()\n# One argument\nsqrt(5197)\n# Two arguments\nsum(2,3)\n# Multiple arguments\nseq(from=1,\n    to = 10, \n    by  = 2)\n```\n\n**Matching arguments**: Some arguments are understood as such by the software. Take for example, generating a sequence includes three arguments viz: from, to, by. The right inputs are automatically matched to the right argument.\n\n```{r}\nseq(1,10,2)\n```\n\n**Caution**: The wrong inputs are also matched. Best practice is to be explicit at early stages. Use argument names!\n\n```{r}\nseq(2,10,1)\nseq(by = 2,\n    to = 10,\n    from = 1)\n```\n\nOptional arguments: Some arguments are optional. They may be added or removed as per requirement. By default these optional arguments are taken by R *as default* values. Take for example, in `sum()` function, `na.rm = FALSE` is an optional argument. It ensures that the NA values are not removed by default and the sum is not returned when there are NA values. These optional arguments can be override by mentioning them explicitly.\n\n```{r}\nsum(2,3,NA)\nsum(2,3,NA, na.rm = T)\n```\n\nIn contrast, the arguments which needs to be mentioned explicitly are mandatory! Without them, errors are returned as output.\n\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n\nsqrt()\n```\n\n### Objects.\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nIf we want to use the results in addition to viewing them in console, we need to store them as objects. To create an object, type the name of the object (Choose wisely, let it be explicit and self explanatory!), then provide an assignment operator. Everything to the right of the operator will be assigned to the object. You can save a single value or output of a function or multiple values or an entire data set in a single object.\n\n```{r}\n# Single value\nx <- 3\nx\n# Output from function\nx <- seq(from=1,\n    to = 10, \n    by  = 2)\n# Better name:\nsequence_from_1_to_10 <- seq(from=1,\n    to = 10, \n    by  = 2)\n```\n\nCreating an object helps us in viewing its contents as well make it easier to apply additional functions\n\n**Tip.** While typing functions/ object names, R prompts are provided. Choose from the prompts rather than typing the entire thing. It will ease out many things later!\n\n:::\n\n```{r}\nsequence_from_1_to_10\nsum(sequence_from_1_to_10)\n```\n\n### Vectors\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nR stores values as a vector which is one dimensional array. Arrays can be two dimensional (similar to excel data/ tabular data), or multidimensional. Vectors are always one dimensional!\n\nVectors can be a single value or a combination of values. We can create our own vectors using `c()` function.\n\n```{r}\nsingle_number <- 3\nsingle_number\nnumber_vector <- c(1,2,3)\nnumber_vector\n```\n\nCreating personalized vectors is powerful as a lot of functions in R takes vectors as inputs.\n\n```{r}\nmean(number_vector)\n```\n\nVectorized functions: The function is applied to each element of the vector:\n\n```{r}\nsqrt(number_vector)\n```\n\nIf we have two vectors of similar lengths (such as columns of a research data), vectorised functions help us compute for new columns by applying the said function on each element of both the vectors and give a vector of the same length (Consider this as a new column in the research data)\n\n```{r}\nnumber_vector2 <- c(3,-4,5.4)\nnumber_vector + number_vector2\n```\n\n:::\n\n### Data Types\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nR recognizes different types of vectors based on the values in the vector.\n\nIf all values are numbers (positive numbers, negative numbers, decimals), R will consider that vector as numerical and allows you to carry out mathematical operations/ functions. You can find the class of the vector by using `class()` function.R labels these vectors as \"double\", \"numeric\", or \"integers\".\n\n```{r}\nclass(number_vector)\nclass(number_vector2)\n```\n\nIf the values are within quotation marks, it is character variable by default. It is equivalent to nominal variable.\n\n```{r}\nalphabets_vector <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\nclass(alphabets_vector)\ninteger_vector <- c(1L,2L)\nclass(integer_vector)\n```\n\nLogical vectors contain TRUE and FALSE values\n\n```{r}\nlogical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE)\nclass(logical_vector)\n```\n\nFactor vectors are categorical variables. Other variable types can be converted to factor type using function`factor()`\n\n```{r}\n\nfactor_vector <- factor(number_vector)\nfactor_vector\n```\n\nWe can add labels to factor vectors using optional arguments\n\n```{r}\nfactor_vector <- factor(number_vector,\n                        levels =c(1,2,3),\n                        labels = c(\"level1\", \n                                   \"level2\", \n                                   \"level3\"))\nfactor_vector\n```\n\n**One vector = One type**. For example: When there is mix of numbers and characters, R will consider all as character.\n\n```{r}\nmix_vector <- c(1,\"a\")\nclass(mix_vector)\n```\n\nNote that the number 1 has been converted into character class.\n\n```{r}\nmix_vector[1]\nmix_vector[1] |> class()\n```\n\nDouble, character, integer, logical, complex, raw, dates, etc... There are many other data types and objects but for now, lets start with these. You will understand additional types as you will proceed in your R journey!\n\n:::\n\n### Lists\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nIn addition to vectors, lists are another powerful objects. A list can be considered as a vector of vectors!! They enable you to store multiple types of vectors together. A list can be made using a `list()` function. It is similar to `c()` function but creates a list rather than a vector. It is a good practice to name the vectors in the list.\n\n```{r}\nexample_list <- list(numbers = number_vector, \n                     alphabets = alphabets_vector)\nclass(example_list)\nexample_list\n```\n\nThe elements of a named list/ a named vector can be called by using a `$`.\n\n```{r}\nexample_list$numbers\n```\n\n:::\n\n### Packages\n\n:::{style=\"text-align:justify\"}\n\nThere are thousands of functions in R. To be computationally efficient, R do not load all functions on start. It loads only base functions. As you want to use additional functions, we need to load the packages using `library()` function.\n\n\\textbf{Important}\n\nThe additional packages are installed once but loaded everytime you start R sessions.\n\nWith these basics, lets deep dive into the workshop!!
