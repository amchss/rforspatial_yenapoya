Day Three continues with a recap and doubt clearance session, followed by an in-depth exploration of spatial epidemiology. Participants will engage with real-life examples, including the historical John Snow map exercise. The session will then introduce different types of spatial data (areal, geostatistical, point patterns, spatio-temporal, and mobility data) along with practical exercises.

The afternoon session covers advanced spatial epidemiology concepts, such as spatial autocorrelation and clustering, with hands-on exercises using global and local measures. The workshop will conclude with demonstrations of real-life examples, followed by a feedback and valedictory session.
